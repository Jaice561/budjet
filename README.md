# budjet
budget is a web app where the user will be able to create a budget list.
I'm using python, I have the back end set up,
I need to work on the front-end to make it look nice

# Technologies Used
HTML
CSS
Python
Django

# Next Steps
Add more css
maybe add an email functionality, where the user will receive an email each month for each budgets.
maybe add a pie chart or a graph so the user is able to visualize the number.
